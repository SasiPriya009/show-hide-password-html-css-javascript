# show-hide-password-html-css-javascript
I have provided all the HTML CSS and JavaScript code that I have used to create this project [Show and hide password], before jumping into the source code file you need to know some important points out of this video tutorial.

As you have seen in the video tutorial, At first we can see a password field with a grey border and eye icon, when I focused on the password field password text moved upward, border and eye icon color changed into the blue with the beautiful animation. To make this animation I have used only HTML CSS. After that, I typed some letters which are not visible and when I clicked on the eye icon password was visible and also eye icon changed at the same time, to make these changes I have used some JavaScript code.

I hope, now you can make this project [Show and Hide Password] easily. If you are feeling difficulty building this project, I have provided all the source code below.
